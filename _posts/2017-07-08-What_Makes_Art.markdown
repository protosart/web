What makes a piece of work a piece of art?

Many say it is the way it highlights the subject matter.  Others would argue it is movement or dynamic lighting that create a 'mood' to the piece.

In my opinion, what turns a piece of work into a work of art is if it makes you feel.  

When you stare at something, pause a moment and consider - what is it you are feeling?  Does the piece seem foreboding and you need to look away quickly?  Does the piece project a calm sense of zen?  Does it feel like you are about to fall into the piece and it will only let you go kicking and screaming?

If you look at something and you feel anything then it has done it's job and the person has created art.

Humans created art, at first, to tell a story - before there was a written language, or perhaps any formal language at all.  Art, in and of itself, is a journal of the state of mind of the artist - where are they in life?  Are they depressed and their works are dark and screaming for help?  Or are they bright and calm, showing that the artist has peace in their life?  Most likely it is a mixture of everything since the majority of humans ride a veritable roller coaster of emotions each given day.

To create something that tells a story, that creates a feeling that lingers with the view even after they have turned away, clicked a button on their keyboard, or even blinked - to manage to have that sort of impact on the individual - that is art.
